      <h2>The Project</h2>
      <p class="sec-text right">We are the University of California, Riverside's competitive autonomous underwater vehicle project, competing internationally in <a href="https://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub">RoboNation's RoboSub Competition</a>.</p>
      <p class="sec-text right">Each year we construct a submarine capable of completing a number of aquatic objectives entirely on its own. The sheer volume of design and construction needed requires a large interdisciplinary team working collaboratively to share expertise and comunication throughout the process.</p>
      <p class="sec-text right">Sponsored by UCR's IEEE and ASME chapters, the project exposes all students to utilizing their coursework skills, working with others outside their major, and granting experience with a large-scale project with real-world applications. For the 2019-2020 academic year, UCR RoboSub has ~30 active members, across almost every engineering major.</p>

      <h2 class="left">The Competition</h2>
      <p class="sec-text left">The RoboSub competition is an annual week-long marathon at the US Navy's TRANSDEC Terminal in San Diego, California. Submarines traverse a randomized objective course, with challenges revolving around core aspects of naval robotics such as course navigation, obstacle identification, and object manipulation. Tasks change slightly by the year's theme, and generally involve navigating a series of paths, identifying and reacting to patterned buoys, pushing on extruded plates, dropping objects, firing torpedoes at targets, and locating acoustic pingers. All without human intervention.</p>

      <h2>Leviathan</h2>
      <p class="sec-text right">Out latest submarine, Leviathan, is the result of a thousand hours of design, development, simulation, and testing. From notebook sketches to competition, we are building this robot from the ground up to compete in the 2020 competiiton. Leviathan features 5 degrees of motion, and is designed for control efficiency and stability. We are currently in the construction phase of the project and are SUPER excited to see the result!</p>
    <!--
      <p class="sec-text right">Our latest submarine, the Seadragon, is the result of a thousand hours of design, development, construction, and testing. From notebook sketches to static judging, we built this robot from the ground up and continue to improve upon it. The Seadragon features pressure sensing, leak sensing, a pan-tilt camera, and a body that has withstood 50+ water tests without failure.</p>
